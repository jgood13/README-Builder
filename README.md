# README-Builder


## Description

For this project I created a README generator through node js that takes in a user's inputs and then uses markdown syntax to generate the readme document as soon as you're finished.

## How to use
While in the main folder you would type 'node index.js' into your terminal. You would then answer all prompts that it gives you. At the end a readme will be generated.

## Challenges

During this project I became much more comfortable with initializing dependancies as well as installing node modules. It's also the first time that I've exported a JS file that I created onto another JS file. Overall it was a pretty quick project but this stuff was great to learn.
